## Recommendations

### For Local Agent Improvement:
1. **6 review task(s) failed**  
   Examples: Review all generated code for performance and best practices, Review entire codebase for security vulnerabilities  
   Suggestion: Review backstory and tool usage for review tasks

2. **9 refactor task(s) failed**  
   Examples: Refactor codebase to implement repository pattern, Refactor multi-file project to use dependency injection pattern  
   Suggestion: Review backstory and tool usage for refactor tasks

3. **16 test task(s) failed**  
   Examples: Add divide function to calculator.py, Create api_client directory and __init__.py  
   Suggestion: Review backstory and tool usage for test tasks

4. **67 code task(s) failed**  
   Examples: Design and implement multi-file web scraper architecture, Design and implement multi-file web scraper architecture  
   Suggestion: Review backstory and tool usage for code tasks

5. **1 debug task(s) failed**  
   Examples: Test 7: Debug and fix validation  
   Suggestion: Review backstory and tool usage for debug tasks

### For Task Routing:
1. **101 task(s) routed differently than expected**  
   Examples:
   - Test 10: Review code quality and generate report: expected unknown, got cto-01 (complexity: 5)
   - Refactor multi-file project to use dependency injection pattern: expected unknown, got cto-01 (complexity: 10)
   - Review all generated code for performance and best practices: expected unknown, got coder-01 (complexity: 10)
   Suggestion: Review complexity scoring thresholds

### For Training Data:
1. **Only 0 successful executions captured**  
   Suggestion: Need 20+ examples for statistically significant training set
