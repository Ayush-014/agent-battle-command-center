{"id":"b9387cda-b358-4da3-849b-c7cf64f18499","title":"Design error handling architecture for agent execution system","description":"You are the CTO reviewing our agent execution system. Design a comprehensive error handling architecture:\n\n1. Analyze current error patterns from execution logs (query recent failed tasks)\n2. Design error classification system (transient vs permanent, recoverable vs fatal)\n3. Propose retry strategies with exponential backoff\n4. Design error recovery workflows (when to retry, when to escalate, when to fail fast)\n5. Create error notification system (what errors need human attention)\n6. Provide implementation recommendations with code examples\n7. Document decision rationale and trade-offs\n\nFocus on strategic design, not implementation. Use your query_logs and review_code tools to analyze the system first.","taskType":"review","requiredAgent":null,"status":"assigned","priority":10,"maxIterations":10,"currentIteration":0,"assignedAgentId":"cto-01","assignedAt":"2026-01-27T01:23:43.531Z","needsHumanAt":null,"humanTimeoutMinutes":15,"escalatedToAgentId":null,"result":null,"error":null,"apiCreditsUsed":"0","timeSpentMs":0,"lockedFiles":[],"parentTaskId":null,"createdAt":"2026-01-27T01:23:08.594Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-27T01:23:43.532Z","completedAt":null,"assignedAgent":{"id":"cto-01","agentTypeId":"e5e62b55-eaac-446d-aebd-b8334c58bbdf","name":"CTO-Sentinel","status":"busy","currentTaskId":"b9387cda-b358-4da3-849b-c7cf64f18499","config":{"preferredModel":"claude-opus-4-5-20251101","alwaysUseClaude":true,"maxContextTokens":16000},"stats":{"successRate":0,"tasksFailed":11,"totalTimeMs":0,"tasksCompleted":0,"totalApiCredits":0},"createdAt":"2026-01-26T20:05:44.665Z","updatedAt":"2026-01-27T01:23:43.538Z","agentType":{"id":"e5e62b55-eaac-446d-aebd-b8334c58bbdf","name":"cto","displayName":"CTO Agent","description":"Strategic supervisor powered by Claude - reviews code, assigns tasks, makes architectural decisions","capabilities":["review_code","assign_task","query_logs","escalate_task","make_decision"],"icon":"crown","color":"#8B5CF6","createdAt":"2026-01-26T20:05:44.648Z"}},"taskExecutions":[],"fileLocks":[],"subTasks":[]}
