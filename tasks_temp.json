Here's the complete content of the created file:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\ndef word_frequency(text):\\\\n    \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n    Calculate the frequency of words in a given text.\\\\n    \\\\n    Args:\\\\n        text (str): The input text to analyze.\\\\n        \\\\n    Returns:\\\\n        dict: A dictionary where keys are words (lowercase) and values are their counts.\\\\n        \\\\n    Examples:\\\\n        >>> word_frequency(\\\\\\\"hello world hello\\\\\\\")\\\\n        {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}\\\\n        \\\\n        >>> word_frequency(\\\\\\\"Hello World

word.lower()\\\\n        word_counts[word_lower] = word_counts.get(word_lower, 0) + 1\\\\n    \\\\n    return word_counts\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Implementation Details:**\\\\n- ✅ Splits text on whitespace using Python's `split()` method (handles multiple spaces, tabs, newlines)\\\\n- ✅ Converts words to lowercase for case-insensitive counting\\\\n- ✅ Returns a dictionary with word counts (e.g., `{'hello': 2, 'world': 1}`)\\\\n- ✅ Handles edge cases: empty strings, whitespace-only strings, mixed case\\\\n- ✅ All 21 comprehensive tests pass successfully\\\\n\\\\nThe file has been created at
